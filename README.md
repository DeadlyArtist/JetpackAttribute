# Jetpack Attribute
Mainly exists just to better support the [More Progression](https://github.com/DeadlyArtist/MinecraftProgression) mod.

## Features
Adds a single jetpack attribute, which enables a jetpack if equal to 1 (max value). Additionally, adds a single jetpack
item that can be put into the chest slot, which provides this attribute, but has no crafting recipe.

## Source
Forked from the [Iron Jetpacks Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-jetpacks-fabric) mod.
